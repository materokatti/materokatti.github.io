`Client Side Rendering`,` Server Side Rendering` and `Single Page Aplication` are an important concept in the modern web. With the advent of the 3rd generation web, SPA helped implement more diverse UX. SPA can be applied in two ways: CSR and SSR. Especially SSR requires a clear understanding because the meaning of the modern web and the traditional meaning are quite different. This can be a bit of a complicated concept. So let's figure it out step by step. 

## BRIEF HISTORY of WEB

 **The first-generation web** was really simple. All the web has to do is present the page. Therefore, HTML and CSS were sufficient to implement this. The **The second generation web** applies responsiveness. They use a programming language for this. Traditional languages didn't work in browsers, that's why they had to create new ones. So they create javascript. But in the second generation of the web, JavaScript used only special circumstances. Also, modern web concepts like APIs are still not well known. Second-generation web pages are called **multi-page applications**. It is called multipage because it consists of two or more HTML files. It is characterized by flickering when moving pages because it moves to different HTML files.
